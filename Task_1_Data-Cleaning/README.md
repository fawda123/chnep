Data cleaning for Task 1 of CHNEP water quality trend analysis project.

Three R Markdown scripts ("01" prefix) contain data cleaning procedures for three datasets: CHNEP data provided by the USF Water Atlas team, WIN data, and STORET data. The R script ("02" prefix) binds the three clean datasets into a single dataframe.

The input data and the clean output data are stored elsewhere (not on github).
